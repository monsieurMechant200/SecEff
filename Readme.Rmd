# SectEff - Cross-Section Analysis

## Overview

SectEff is a complete R library dedicated to the analysis and visualization of cross sections in nuclear physics, particle physics, and their innovative applications in digital marketing. The package provides a set of mathematical, statistical, and visualization tools to model physical interactions and behavioral processes.

## Why SectEff?

The concept of cross section is fundamental in physics to quantify the probability of interaction between particles. SectEff extends this rigorous approach to new domains such as marketing analytics, while still offering a full set of tools for physics research.

## Local Installation

```
install.packages("path/to/SectEff", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

## Quick Start

### Example 1: Rutherford Scattering

```r
library(SectEff)

theta <- seq(10, 170, by = 1)
Z1 <- 2
Z2 <- 79
E  <- 5

sigma <- sigma_rutherford(theta, Z1, Z2, E)

plot_angular_distribution(
  theta,
  sigma,
  type = "polar",
  main = "Alpha Scattering on Gold"
)
```

### Example 2: Breit-Wigner Resonance

```r
E <- grille_energie(0.1, 10, n = 500, log = TRUE)

params <- data.frame(
  E0 = c(1.5, 3.0, 5.5),
  Gamma = c(0.2, 0.3, 0.4),
  sigma0 = c(5, 8, 3)
)

sigma <- sigma_multiresonance(E, params)

plot_resonance(E, sigma, title = "Multiple Resonances")
```

### Example 3: Marketing Application

```r
impressions <- 1e6
conversions <- 5000
density <- 0.7

eff <- sigma_marketing(conversions, impressions, density)
cat("Marketing efficiency: ", eff, "\n")

exposures <- seq(1, 20, by = 1)
sigma0 <- eff
mu <- 0.15

efficiency <- sigma_fatigue(sigma0, mu, exposures)

plot_sigma(
  exposures,
  efficiency,
  xlab = "Number of Exposures",
  ylab = "Relative Efficiency",
  main = "Advertising Fatigue Curve"
)
```

### Example 4: Full Dashboard

```r
E_theo <- grille_energie(0.5, 8, n = 200, log = FALSE)
sigma_theo <- sigma_breit_wigner(E_theo, E0 = 3, Gamma = 0.5, sigma0 = 10)

E_exp <- seq(1, 7, by = 0.5)
sigma_exp <- sigma_breit_wigner(E_exp, 3, 0.5, 10) + rnorm(length(E_exp), 0, 0.5)

plot_dashboard(E_theo, sigma_theo, sigma_exp, E_exp)
```

## Theoretical Concepts

### Microscopic Cross Section

The cross section sigma quantifies the probability of interaction:

```
sigma = N_reactions / (N_projectiles * n_targets * thickness)
```

Unit: barn (1 barn = 1e-28 m2)

### Rutherford Formula

For Coulomb scattering:

```
d_sigma / d_Omega = (Z1 * Z2 * e2 / 4E)^2 * 1 / sin(theta / 2)^4
```

### Breit-Wigner Formula

Resonance modeling:

```
sigma(E) = sigma0 * (Gamma^2 / 4) / ((E - E0)^2 + (Gamma^2 / 4))
```

## Typical Workflows

### Workflow 1: Full Experimental Analysis

```r
E_exp <- read.csv("data/energy.csv")$E
counts <- read.csv("data/counts.csv")$counts

sigma_exp <- sigma_exp(counts, N0 = 1e10, n = 1e22, t = 3600)

E_theo <- grille_energie(min(E_exp), max(E_exp), n = 500)
sigma_theo <- sigma_breit_wigner(E_theo, E0 = 2.5, Gamma = 0.3, sigma0 = 12)

plot_dashboard(E_theo, sigma_theo, sigma_exp, E_exp)
```

### Workflow 2: Marketing Optimization

```r
densities <- seq(0.3, 0.9, by = 0.1)

efficiencies <- sapply(densities, function(d) {
  sigma_marketing(5000, 1e6, d)
})

plot(
  densities,
  efficiencies,
  type = "b",
  pch = 19,
  xlab = "Targeting Density",
  ylab = "Efficiency",
  main = "Targeting Optimization"
)
```
